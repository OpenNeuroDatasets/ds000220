General Comments
----------------
For each subject, sessions occured approximately three months apart.

Defacing
--------
Defacing for the anatomical images for subjects control01-control06 was 
performed by the submitter.
Pydeface was used on the anatomical images for the rest of the subjects. The code
can be found at https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface

Quality Control
